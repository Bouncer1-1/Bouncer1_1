## What im About
### I have been into Gaming for my entire life (Before i was 10) and I have recently been contemplating a career change. A quote that has been resonating in my head is this , "You can fail at doing something you hate, so what is your excuse for not doing what you love?".

## My Motivation
###   I am no stranger to working, I have been a part of multiple industries throughout the years but the unifying factor for many of the jobs I have had are: 
1.) I needed a paycheck 
2.) I had some sort of interest in the field (at least for a time)

I now have a desire to make a career change that works with my gaming hobby.

# Where to Start?
  ### Thru the multiple hours of research, and I am sure there will be changes made to my learning roadmap along the way. I have come to the conclusion that it would be in my best interest to hit the ground running.
  so here are my basic guidlines for the beginning of my journey.

##1.) LEARN THE BASICS
### A constant reminder in multiple instances of my working life have confirmed the idea in my mind that if you learn the basic concept of what you are doing, then EVERYTHING afterwards is magnitudes easier to understand. With this in mind, and the understanding that coding in general, there is always something changing. Best thing I can do is just start. Code and Learn.

##2.) Network
### Another thing I have learned before is that "you dont find opportunities, they are offered to you". With this in mind, I hope to network with other people in many different places that share a simular interest. This is a difficult task for me since I happen to be quite compfortable entertaining myself.

##3.) Challenge
### "Nothing ever comes from sitting on the couch" This basic concept should be applied towards not just learning, but networking and many other places. simply put, I need to consitantly be at least willing to leave my compfort zone, push my boundaries, and be willing to make mistakes as long as I learn from them.
